# Question: Service Availability During Deployment

## Task

### Minimize the occurrence of 503 - Service Unavailable errors during deployments.

1. Utilize Kubernetes deployments instead of directly running pods to ensure better control over your application's lifecycle.

2. Within your deployments, implement Rolling Updates rather than recreating pods. This approach ensures a smoother transition between versions, reducing the likelihood of service unavailability.

3. Employ environment variables inside your pods and utilize ConfigMaps as volumes. This practice enables you to update connection parameters to your backend SQL servers seamlessly by modifying the ConfigMap, simplifying configuration management.

4. Expose your deployment as a service, such as NodePort, to make your application accessible and maintain communication during deployments.

5. Consider implementing an Ingress Controller, like the NGINX ingress controller, to efficiently manage external access to your services and enhance routing capabilities.

6. Implement health checks for all external dependencies (Database, Kafka, Redis) to ensure they are ready before considering the service itself as ready. Kubernetes provides readiness probes that can be defined in your service's pod configuration. These probes can be customized to check the health of dependencies before allowing traffic to be routed to the service.

For example, you can create readiness probes for each dependency by defining HTTP endpoints, TCP checks, or custom scripts to verify the health of these dependencies. Your service should only be considered ready when all dependency readiness probes report success.

### Ensure that the service is only considered ready when all its required dependencies are also ready.

1. Implement Readiness and Liveness Probes to assess the health of your service and its dependencies. This proactive monitoring ensures that your service is considered ready only when all required components are in a healthy state.

2. Leverage labels from your deployment as selector labels in your service configuration to ensure that the service correctly routes traffic to pods with the necessary dependencies.
